### Development Preview ###
<span class="build">Build 220521-75ec9909</span>

This service release fixes potential issues with our new Debian 12-based Docker image that was part of the last update. These may have prevented some users from updating PhotoPrism without making changes to their environment.

In our ongoing effort to improve usability and performance, we have also implemented a number of user interface optimizations. For example, the UI now uses the operating system font by default instead of Google's Roboto.

- UX: [Added submenu to mobile navigation toolbar](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/8b5fbec950ddf6209609f17fa829cc8adabf3699)

- Auth: [Short initial passwords are permitted again to avoid login problems](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2339)
- Logs: [Repeated log messages are omitted to prevent feedback loops](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2335)
- Logs: [Trace and debug messages are no longer displayed in the UI to avoid information leaks and reduce the amount of data transmitted via Websockets](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2335)
- Search: [`mono:true` filter now omits files with unknown chroma](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2341)
- Docker: [Removed incorrect permission check for storage folder on startup](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2334)
- Docker: [Supported User and Group ID ranges have been documented](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/2336)

"Bullseye" and include many updated dependencies such as [Darktable 3.8](https://www.darktable.org/2022/02/darktable-3.8.1-released/).
Behind the scenes, the build process has also been improved so that it will be easier to provide standalone packages in the future.

<span class="build">Build 220107-f5b7ef83</span>

Based on our zero bug policy, this update focuses on bug fixes, security, and UX improvements for search 
filters, metadata, and the indexer. In addition, one of the merged pull requests may improve face recognition

### December 15, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211215-93b26f19</span>

PhotoPrism is not directly affected by the [Apache Log4j](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2021/12/log4j-zero-day-log4shell-arrives-just-in-time-to-ruin-your-weekend/) vulnerability.
Logs may still contain messages that can cause harm if consumed by an unpatched Java application.
As a precaution, this release includes additional [rules and filters to validate user input](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1814).

- Sharing: [Fixed album link redirect on shared domains](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1617)

### December 10, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211210-2cb90e7e</span>

Starting with this release, the [regular multi-arch Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/photoprism/photoprism/tags?name=latest) is 64-bit only. 
A 32-bit version of our stable release for [older devices](getting-started/raspberry-pi.md#older-armv7-based-devices) 
is offered separately. This frees up development and infrastructure resources with minimal impact.

- [Based on Go version 1.17.5, which includes important HTTP/2 and network security fixes](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/hcmEScgc00k)
- People: [Concurrent updates are no longer possible to prevent inconsistencies](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/1b583e071e80b68352b1b366d60e010d8f8f9535)

- Thumbnails: [Apple Display P3 profile support for more accurate colors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1798)
- Translations: [Updated French](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/pull/1799)

### December 3, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211203-fdb6b5e1</span>

Since the [funding goal](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsor) required to make all features and maps generally
available has not been reached, *early-access features* have been renamed to *sponsor features* in this update.
Offline and high-resolution street maps remain free for everyone, while hybrid, topographic, and outdoor maps are 
now a sponsor feature. We believe this is fair. A big thank you to all our [sponsors](https://link.photoprism.app/sponsors)
and [contributors](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/graphs/contributors/)!

- CLI: [Improved parameter](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1778) and [command descriptions](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1735)
- CLI: [Reset command optionally also deletes files in the cache folder](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1787)
- Config: [Improved `docker-compose.yml` examples](https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/)

### November 30, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211130-13cfcf6d</span>

- UI: New *Abyss* and *Gemstone* dark themes ðŸ’Ž

### November 28, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211128-7e8974fd</span>

Official support for MySQL 8 is discontinued with this update as Oracle seems to have stopped shipping [new features and improvements](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1764).
As a result, the testing effort required before each release is no longer feasible. We recommend [upgrading](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/troubleshooting/#version-upgrade)
to [MariaDB 10.6](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/function-differences-between-mariadb-106-and-mysql-80/) or later.
PostgreSQL support is [planned for 2022](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/47) without a specific release date yet.

- CLI: [`photoprism migrations run --failed` will re-run previously failed migrations](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/commit/7e8974fd20fcbf3ec403541125599deaeb1ee353)

### November 27, 2021 ###
<span class="build">Build 211127-86c43159</span>

When possible, location estimates now include a latitude and longitude. Photos load faster when you open 
them in *Places*, and the viewer sorts them by distance. Time zone handling has been completely reworked, 
in particular for UTC. The Docker base image has been upgraded to Ubuntu 21.10, which ships with 
Darktable 3.6 among other updated dependencies.
